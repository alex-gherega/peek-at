## Clojure env setup

First step: have a minimal setup for Clojure dev env.

[This](https://github.com/alex-gherega/clojure-env-setup) setup is for [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) 
with [lein](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) and [cider](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider).

The current Clojure community has moved on from lein to [boot](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot) (a more powerful project automation tool).
